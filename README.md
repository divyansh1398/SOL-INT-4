# Sol_advance_4

The Anchor Framework program outlined here is structured to execute the creation of NFTs, followed by staking and unstaking processes. The duration between these actions correlates directly with the quantity of fungible tokens to be minted.

## Description

This is a smart contract developed in Devnet using the Anchor framework. A client program is included for the purpose of testing and engaging with the smart contract.
